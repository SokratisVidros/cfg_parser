A psychotic billionaire attempts to sabotage the World Cup 
by stealing a nuclear bomb. Bond encounters his nemesis and 
they play poker, cheating shamelessly. Subsequently, Bond 
meets a exotic CIA agent, whom he seduces. During that 
time, Bond is abducted by ninjas and thrown to sharks. In a 
hair-raising action sequence, he escapes by using his 
fake-tooth flamethrower. Finally, with only seconds to 
spare, Bond wrestles a mutant alligator with his bare hands 
and prepares to explain to Q what happened to the car.

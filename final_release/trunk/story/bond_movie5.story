A psychotic billionaire attempts to sabotage the World Cup 
by wrecking the global economy. Bond encounters his nemesis 
and they play poker, cheating shamelessly. During that 
time, Bond meets a glamorous KGB agent, whom he enchants. 
Within minutes, Bond is abducted by ninjas and chained to a 
bomb. Incredibly, he escapes by using his inflatable 
submarine. Finally, with only 007 seconds to spare, Bond 
defuses the bomb using a chewing gum and prepares to 
explain to Q what happened to the car.
